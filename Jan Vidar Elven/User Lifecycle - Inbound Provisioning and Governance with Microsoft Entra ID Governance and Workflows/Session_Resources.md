## Title

User Lifecycle - Inbound Provisioning and Governance with Microsoft Entra ID Governance and Workflows

## Description

It all begins and ends with an Identity! Before the users and their devices can be managed, they need to be onboarded and provisioned with their user account. This is where Microsoft Entra Provisioning API and Lifecycle Workflows in Entra ID Governance enters the scene. By automating scenarios for Joiner, Mover and Leaver we can set up templates and tasks that for example automatically sends out a Temporary Access Pass for new hires which they can use for first time setting up their account and device to be securely managed! We can even implement custom tasks and extensions via Azure Logic Apps, that can trigger other APIs or even something you've built in Azure Functions! Learn how to use these lifecycle templates and customize tasks with serverless solutions in this awesome deep dive workshop where automation black belt Jan Vidar will share his best tips and tricks for implementing a successful Identity Governance that supports a seamless and automated user on- and offboarding!
